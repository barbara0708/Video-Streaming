  We offer 2 types of upload:
  
  * Regular upload
  
  * Progressive upload
  
  The latter allows you to split a video source into X chunks and send those chunks independently (concurrently or sequentially). The 2 main goals for our users are to
  
    * allow the upload of video sources > 200 MiB (200 MiB = the max. allowed file size for regular upload)
  
    * allow to send a video source "progressively", i.e., before before knowing the total size of the video.
  
    Once all chunks have been sent, they are reaggregated to one source file. The video source is considered as "completely sent" when the "last" chunk is sent (i.e., the chunk that "completes" the upload).
  
  
     * Upload a video
     * @param videoId Enter the videoId you want to use to upload your video.
     * @param file The path to the video you would like to upload. The path must be local. If you want to use a video from an online source, you must use the \\\&quot;/videos\\\&quot; endpoint and add the \\\&quot;source\\\&quot; parameter when you create a new video.
