     * Webhooks can push notifications to your server, rather than polling api.video for changes. We currently offer four events:  * ```video.encoding.quality.completed``` Occurs when a new video is uploaded into your account, it will be encoded into several different HLS and mp4 qualities. When each version is encoded, your webhook will get a notification.  It will look like ```{ \"type\": \"video.encoding.quality.completed\", \"emittedAt\": \"2021-01-29T16:46:25.217+01:00\", \"videoId\": \"viXXXXXXXX\", \"encoding\": \"hls\", \"quality\": \"720p\"} ```. This request says that the 720p HLS encoding was completed. * ```live-stream.broadcast.started```  When a live stream begins broadcasting, the broadcasting parameter changes from false to true, and this webhook fires. * ```live-stream.broadcast.ended```  This event fires when a live stream has finished broadcasting. * ```video.source.recorded```  This event occurs when a live stream is recorded and submitted for encoding.
